# Random-Forest-Model-Using-Sklearn

A very simple Random Forest Classifier implemented in python. The sklearn.ensemble library was used to import the RandomForestClassifier class. The object of the class was created. The following arguments was passed initally to the object:

n_estimators = 10
criterion = 'entropy'
The inital model was only given 10 decision tree, which resulted the accurecy of 92%
